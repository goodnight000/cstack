# Review loop: judge panel, routing, stop rule

## Panel
Three independent judges per render, each with a lens and a structured critique: `{score 1–10,
verdict, issues[{start_sec, end_sec, severity, problem, fix}], keep[]}`. Tell each one to
extract frames itself, relate them to `words.json`, read the source for precise fixes, and
write only under `out/judge/`. Judge against the current brief and platform. Past films aren't the benchmark.
- **Animation or motion director:** on-model consistency against the reference, acting,
  anticipation and overshoot, continuity across cuts, and broken frames (missing limbs, z-order,
  pops, ghosting, empty frames).
- **Growth and story:** does frame 0 stop the scroll in 1.5s; is each line shown with the sound
  off; the emotional arc; dead stretches over 3s; comment or share moments; an ending that loops.
- **Design and sound:** composition, colour script, accent discipline, safe zones, caption
  legibility, and the audio measured with ffmpeg (VO-to-bed ratio, masking, loudness, true peak).

## Routing fixes
- Route each issue to the owner of its time range (the act files). Issues spanning 20s or more
  go to a global owner (`Film.tsx`: captions, mix, transitions). Run fixers in parallel on
  disjoint files. Pass the judges' `keep` lists so fixes don't break what works.
- The workflow shape used: kit (1 agent), then acts (8 in parallel), then render, then judges
  (3), then routed rework (up to 8), then render, and repeat for at most 2 rework rounds.

## One project's numbers (a 74s vertical short): evidence, not targets
| Track | Scores by round | Wall time | Agents / tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Motion graphics v1→v3 | 5/5/5 → 6/6/6.5 → 6/7/6.5 | about 45 min | 11 / 1.55M |
| v4 rework (resumed) | 6/6/6 | about 18 min | 4 live / 0.6M |
| v5 polish (single agent) | not judged | about 19 min | 1 / 0.23M |
| Cartoon kit+acts+2 reworks | 6/6/6.1 → 6.5/7/6.5 → 7/7/6.4 | about 2.5 h | 36 / 6.1M |

## Lessons
- Scores plateau fast. After round 2, the top issue in both tracks was something only the user
  could supply or decide (their face, the format). Stop and ask instead of adding rounds.
- Scores aren't comparable across rounds, because judges recalibrate (v3→v4 design went from 7
  to 6 while the film improved). Track the open issues, not the number.
- Your own spot-check after each render still catches things: a per-word duck that pumps, a
  see-through character, floating legs, a blurred last frame. Pull frames at every flagged
  time before reporting "done".
- A long run needs visible progress. Send the latest contact sheet and an ETA at each stage
  boundary.
