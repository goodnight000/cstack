# Local media reference

Use the installed tools and existing project scripts before writing another helper.
For native Resolve assembly and final render, follow [Resolve](resolve.md);
FFmpeg cut/render recipes below support preprocessing, previews, or other briefs.
Examples below are recipes, not commands to run blindly: replace `IN`, `OUT`,
dimensions, paths, and range labels with the probed project values. Quote
paths, keep source files untouched, and overwrite only known derived outputs.

## Probe and transcribe

```bash
ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height,r_frame_rate,sample_aspect_ratio,pix_fmt,sample_rate,channel_layout:stream_tags=rotate:stream_side_data=rotation:format=duration -of json IN
ffmpeg -v error -i IN -vn -ac 1 -ar 16000 audio.wav
uvx --from mlx-whisper mlx_whisper audio.wav --model mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo --word-timestamps True --output-format json --output-dir . --verbose False
```

Prefer an existing local Whisper environment/model cache over downloading
another. On non-Apple-Silicon hosts use the available local Whisper backend.
Probe rotation, color/HDR information when relevant, and displayed geometry;
encoded width/height alone may describe a rotated source incorrectly.

For silence candidates use `silencedetect=noise=-35dB:d=0.25` in an FFmpeg
audio filter and inspect its output. Adjust to the recording's noise floor.
Compare low-energy consonants with nearby waveform/frame evidence before
moving boundaries. The threshold is a search aid, not a rule to delete every pause.

Whisper can suppress repeated words across adjacent takes, hallucinate over silence, miss weak onsets, absorb padding into
word timestamps, and misspell names. Keep the raw transcript and a separate
checked spelling map. Do not fix missing or incomplete spoken words by
changing captions. ASR recognition is not proof of an intact phoneme.

## Quiet external audio and separate recordings

Measure channels independently before mixing or applying gain. A stereo file can
contain one silent channel and usable speech on the other. Inspect speech level,
noise and isolated peaks across early, middle and late passages. A single peak
near full scale does not mean speech is loud enough, and fixed gain can clip it.
Test extraction of the active channel, gentle filtering, adaptive gain/compression
and normalization on representative samples before processing the full recording.
Preserve originals and decoded timing. Measure the encoded listening copy as well
as the PCM master: AAC overshoot can require more headroom.
Usable recovered speech is a reason to test salvage before suggesting a retake;
signal checks cannot establish the original app/input-setting cause or listening quality.

With camera reference audio, locate a coarse offset using speech envelopes, then
refine on selected waveform windows. Check multiple positions per recording for
drift; do not infer a single offset across unrelated camera files. Account for
encoder/start timestamps separately from decoded sample positions. With silent
video, match distinctive mouth movements and reactions to the transcript and
audio, record the uncertainty, and seek a user anchor only if the available
evidence cannot resolve the alignment. Transcript similarity alone cannot prove sync.

## Preflight and source color

Estimate disk use before a long preview, source conversion, or installation.
Reuse completed transcripts and frame surveys after a storage failure. Resume
only the failed stage; do not delete original or unrelated files to make room.

Compare a short actual export against the source appearance before full finishing.
iPhone HLG/Dolby Vision can become washed out through the wrong transform.
One checked workflow normalized selected full-resolution source windows
with half-second handles, then used unmanaged Rec.709 in Resolve to avoid a
second HDR transform. This was technical normalization, not a creative grade.

The verified FFmpeg filter for that particular source was:

```text
zscale=t=linear:npl=100,format=gbrpf32le,zscale=p=bt709,tonemap=hable:peak=10:desat=0,zscale=t=bt709:m=bt709:r=tv,format=yuv420p
```

It was encoded at full upright 1080x1920/60fps with H.264 VideoToolbox at 40 Mbps,
tagged BT.709. Resolve used `davinciYRGB` with Rec.709 Gamma 2.4 timeline/output.
These values are a source-specific working example, not a universal iPhone LUT.
Probe each recording, inspect the sample, and retain original HDR media. Reuse
normalized windows for revisions whose source ranges remain within their handles.

## Cut and render

For simple synchronized cuts, write an FFmpeg filter file from the cutlist:

```text
[0:v]trim=start=A:end=B,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v0];
[0:a]atrim=start=A:end=B,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS,afade=t=in:d=0.005,afade=t=out:st=DUR_MINUS_008:d=0.008[a0];
...
[v0][a0][v1][a1]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[vout][aout]
```

Micro-fades reduce clicks; make them short enough to preserve consonants.
For independent picture/audio cuts, concatenate each track separately and
check matching total durations. Record the incoming pre-roll and picture
join explicitly. Do not create a frozen face to fill every missing handle.

Use a smaller, fast-encoded preview until the story and layout settle.
For final social delivery, these are starting settings, not platform mandates:

```bash
ffmpeg -i IN -filter_complex_script filters.txt -map '[vout]' -map '[aout]' -c:v libx264 -crf 19 -preset medium -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart master.mp4
```

An upload copy can use CRF 23 and AAC 128k when it remains visually adequate.
Prefer generating final variants from the same high-quality source over
chaining unnecessary lossy transcodes. Match fps, dimensions, SAR, audio
layout, and sample rate across concatenated sources. Upscaling does not
restore detail in a low-resolution asset.

Apply tempo changes consistently to video, audio, captions, and overlays.
Do not use source seconds as output seconds after a speed change. Preserve
natural voice pitch with the available tempo filter and check delivery in context.

For audio, start near -14 LUFS with peak headroom, for example
`highpass=f=70,loudnorm=I=-14:TP=-1.5:LRA=11,aresample=48000`, adapting to the
source and mix. Measure the actual final export because encoding/mixing
can change loudness and peaks. Sparse sound effects should sit below speech.
For a reported inaudible bed, compare the stem, intended mix, and exported mix
in matching speech and pause intervals. Stereo-side energy can be dominated by
camera ambience, so it does not reliably isolate music. Native pitch correction
may change PCM between renders; a hash mismatch alone does not identify a mix
fault. Use contextual audio review when available and report the limits of
signal measurements. For brief SFX, whole-clip RMS can conceal a strong transient:
compare short active windows with speech at the same instant as well as the whole
effect. Short windows, such as 50 ms, are a diagnostic, not an audibility threshold.
A positive effect-to-speech ratio during a speech pause does not establish masking.
Keep project-specific gain changes in the project.

## Captions

When overlays change position, inspect captions at entry/exit boundaries as well
as settled frames. A caption starting just before a layout boundary can continue
into the next visual and collide. Use a phrase-specific position override rather
than moving an entire caption track. Fit product crops with contain when the
whole silhouette matters; fill/crop can accidentally truncate the object.

For an FFmpeg/ASS caption path, reuse [make_captions.py](../scripts/make_captions.py); its docstring defines
the input schema. A minimal cutlist looks like:

```json
{
  "segments": [{"src_start": 25.29, "src_end": 28.77, "out_start": 0}],
  "fix": {"Alexx": "Alex"},
  "style": {"play_res": [1080, 1920], "font": "Arial", "size": 72,
            "margin_lr": 100, "margin_v": 350}
}
```

These sample margins are not a universal safe area. Measure the actual
face/content and account for the destination's interface.

```bash
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/make_captions.py audio.json cutlist.json captions.ass --expected expected.txt
```

The generator uses short chunks, punctuation/gap breaks, and caption timing
clamped against the next chunk. Require zero overlaps. Check captions against
the final duration and ensure the last selected word survives the cutlist's
boundary filter. Correct name spelling without changing the spoken meaning.
For speed changes, supply word timings in final output time or map them
explicitly; this generator's source-to-output offset alone does not scale time.

The helper expects checked local JSON and uses fixed phrase/timing heuristics.
It selects words whose start falls inside the cut, excluding the final 50 ms,
and adds caption padding. Inspect boundary words and clamp output to the actual
export duration. Very close phrases can still overlap because of the minimum
display duration. The overlap warning does not produce a failing exit code;
inspect the reported count and repair timing before burning. Review caption text
containing ASS control characters before rendering it.

Run its dependency-free CLI check with:

```sh
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/test_make_captions.py
```

Burn with the ASS/subtitles filter from a working directory where its paths
resolve. Preserve the uncaptioned render when useful for later changes.

## Visual geometry and evidence

For punch-ins, derive even crop dimensions from the zoom factor and anchor
the crop to keep relevant content visible. Recalculate caption/overlay bounds
after cropping. Only add a zoom or end card when it serves the brief.

Extract a survey using an FFmpeg `fps`, `scale`, and `tile` filter; inspect
specific frames around each changed picture cut and overlay transition.
Use the actual picture join, not only the audio cut, for split edits. Check
the caption band at representative times throughout the edit, using the
configured caption location rather than assuming the bottom 260 pixels.

Check original asset identity across aliases/crops. Calculate the union of
visible overlay intervals, then measure its complement from time zero to
the final duration. Include fades conservatively; do not rely on an almost
transparent image to satisfy the active coverage limit.

For a reported freeze, compare consecutive frames around that transition
and inspect actual motion. For a reported pause, inspect audio around the
join. Combine these with contextual playback/listening when available;
duplicate-frame and silence tests alone cannot certify natural pacing.

## Delivery checks and caching

```bash
ffmpeg -v error -i OUT -f null -
ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height,r_frame_rate:format=duration,size -of json OUT
```

Extract final mixed audio for one independent local transcription and
compare substantive speech against the selected dialogue. Keep that QA
transcript separate from caption inputs so a new ASR error cannot silently
rewrite verified captions.

Reuse transcription and caption timing after a picture-only change only
when the audio and edit timeline remain unchanged. An unchanged audio
artifact, identical decoded PCM, or equivalent pipeline evidence can establish
reuse; a filename alone cannot. Recheck affected joins, speed/mix changes,
and the final ending when audio does change. Decode each delivered file.

Render only changed overlay scenes and reuse unchanged assets. Cache validity
depends on source identity, timing and layout inputs, not output-file existence:
invalidate the affected MOV after changing its manifest. Generate review sheets
after their full-frame images are ready; a stale thumbnail caused a false subtitle
report in a prior edit. Resolve a suspected defect against the current full-size frame
before rerendering. Sample each delayed layer entry and outgoing context, not only
one frame per scene. Static samples still do not prove animation or listening quality.

## Reusable media library

Use the project's existing asset index if one exists. Otherwise keep a small
manifest alongside the edit with original identity, local path, source URL,
source time range, credit or license requirements, selection status, spoken cue,
and where the asset was used. No separate catalog service is required.

Preserve original identity across renamed files and crops. Count source works
separately from useful variants, such as one music recording in source, extended,
and ducked forms. Exact hashes detect identical files; audio deduplication may
need aligned, gain-normalized waveform comparison and review of likely matches.
Similar whooshes are not automatically duplicates. Enforce any brief-specific
reuse limits against original identities rather than filenames.

For sound compilations, inspect each onset and tail for neighboring sounds or
truncation. Mark uncertain effects provisional and choose sounds for actual cues.
Keep rejected candidates out of active selections while preserving files used by
older projects. Source provenance is not publication permission.

## Extending a short music recording

Find a musically matching phrase return and crossfade it instead of blindly
restarting the track at its end. Preserve pitch if a small tempo fit is needed;
align intro/outro to the final timeline, duck under speech, and keep a requested
music-free hook silent in the music stem. Inspect loop boundaries in context when
listening is available. Loop length and crossfade duration depend on the recording;
numeric settings alone do not prove a seamless audible loop.

## Repeated-speech checks

Treat unexpectedly long word timestamps as a reason to inspect the underlying
audio. A recognizer can assign a single word a long interval containing repeated
speech. A long transcription and a short check ending at the previous take can
both miss it.

Inspect overlapping windows containing the outgoing phrase, the join, and the
first phrase of the incoming clip. Include the interior of a selected passage
when a word spans an implausibly long interval or the source contains restarts;
a repeat can survive entirely within one clip. Use tiny source windows to localize a suspect
repeat, then verify the combined final join again. Tiny-window ASR can also
hallucinate; reconcile conflicting results against source context, waveform, and
listening when available. An instruction to transcribe verbatim does not make
the recognizer reliable by itself.

## Frame-rounded timing

Keep source positions, normal-speed record frames, and final output frames
separate. Use integer frames for edits; round only at conversion boundaries.
After a removal, map every dependent layer through the same removed interval.
After a speed change, compare predicted duration with the native result.

For final manifests assert `0 <= start < end <= exported_duration`, caption
bounds/no unintended overlap, and matching picture/audio end frames. Calculate
visual coverage using merged intervals, not a sum of individual durations.
Read or derive one current speed, rather than carrying per-item values from a
previous version. Leave a small margin inside the current brief's timing limits.
